Implementation
---------------

Use a genetic algorithm to recreate Molnar's homage to Durer. Basic steps for the algorithm (via [projectspot](http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/creating-a-genetic-algorithm-for-beginners/3)):


### Initialization

Start with a unique randomized set of arrays.

### Evaluation

Abstractly, eveluation should probably be based on how close the image "looks" to Molnar's final composition. However, this is not an easy feat so we may have to stick with numbers.

One simple evaluation could be the distance of each individual's position to the desired position. So For instance:

```javascript
// these are the positions of our desired outcome
var desired = [0, 13, 14, 3, 11, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 4, 12, 1, 2, 15];

// these are the positions of our individual
var individual = [1, 2, 12, 3, 13, 4, 7, 14, 8, 9, 10, 6, 15, 11, 0, 5];

// we have a granular fitness that contains the distance between each
// individual value and the desired outcome
var granularFitness = [];

// --> [1, 11, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 10, 2, 10]
individual.forEach(function(value, index){
  granularFitness.push(Math.abs(desired[index] - value));
});


// this will just add all of the granular fitnesses together a lower number is better
var overallFitness = granularFitness.reduce(function(mem, value, i) {
  return mem + value;
});
```

### Selection

Sort the individuals by fitness, mate the most fit with each other. Should the most fit pair have more children? Is it necessary to remove some individuals from mating?

```javascript

// assume this is an array of existing individuals
var individuals;
// the maternity ward
var children;
// this will contain more info
var evaluatedIndividuals;
// the number of individuals that will be completely
var extinctions = 2;

// first evaluate fitness on each individual and
individuals = individuals.map(function(individual, index) {
  return {
    // the dna is the original array
    dna: individual
    // assuming that we have a function defined that uses
    // the fitness evaluation above
    , granularFitness = getGranularFitness(individual)
    , overallFitness = getOverallFitness(individual)
  }
})

// now sort them
individuals = individuals.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a.overallFitness - b.overallFitness;
});

// turn into array of pairs
var pairs = []
while(individuals.length) {
  pairs.push(individuals.splice(0, 2));
}

// if we want to remove the weakest from
// the gene pool altogether
// pairs.pop();


var children = []

// going to "mate" each pair both ways,
// so each pair ends up with 2 kids
pairs.forEach(function(pair, index) {
  children.push(mateIndividuals(pair[0], pair[1]));
  children.push(mateIndividuals(pair[1], pair[0]));
});

// in cases where we remove individuals from the gene pool,
// we should fill in with randomly generated individuals
while(children.length < individuals.length) {
  children.push(getRandomIndividual());
}

```

Now we should have a new generation of mated children.

### Crossover

Need to combine attributes of selected individuals for new population. Essentially a random mixing? This is a little tricky because we need to maintain the same unique set of numbers.


**Duh, they should be _mating_ not transforming each other. Final result should be a single offspring**

```javascript
// our two love birds
var individual1 = [1, 2, 12, 3, 13, 4, 7, 14, 8, 9, 10, 6, 15, 11, 0, 5];
var individual2 = [13, 8, 15, 11, 14, 7, 12, 4, 1, 3, 2, 10, 5, 0, 9, 6];

// our baby-to-be
var child = [];

// our algorithm will have one parent that is genetically
// dominant, and one that is less so (although it may work
// the other way around in certain situations)
var dominantParent;
var nonDominantParent;


// 1. randomly select a parent to be the initial genetic contributor
if(Math.random() < 0.5) {
  dominantParent = individual1;
  nonDominantParent = individual2;
} else {
  dominantParent = individual2;
  nonDominantParent = individual1;  
}

// 2. randomly select indexes to copy over verbatim.

dominantParent.forEeach(function(value, index) {
  child[index] = (Math.random() < 0.5) ? value : undefined;
});

// 3. iterate through empty slots in the child array & copy in from the other parent
//    if those values aren't already in the child array

child.forEach(function(value, index) {
  if(typeof value === 'undefined' && child.indexOf(nonDominatParent[index]) === -1) {
    child[index] = nonDominantParent[index];
  };
});

// 4. fill in any remaining values
if(child.length < individual1.length) {
  individual1.forEach(function(value) {
    var nextEmpty;
    if(child.indexOf(value) === -1) {
      nextEmpty = child.indexOf(undefined);
      child[nextEmpty] = value;
    }
  });
}
```

Now we should have a merged version of both parent arrays, with some potential, mutation in cases where there were empty slots that needed to be filled.

### Mutation

Because of how the crossover algorithm works, there should be some built-in mutation. However, may want to add another mutation step depending on how things work.

## Data format

It would probably be nice to store the geneology of our drawings as a particular data type. But what?

Present as a webpage that loads just as a duplication of Molnar's composition in the window. Scrolling down will reveal:

 - A description of the project
 - An image of each previous generation, including information about those which were selected.
